### Relational Databases and Datastore
To add persistence to your models, use
[NDB](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/) for
scale. 

### Installing Libraries
See the [Third party
libraries](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27)
page for libraries that are already included in the SDK.  To include SDK
libraries, add them in your app.yaml file. Other than libraries included in
the SDK, only pure python libraries may be added to an App Engine project.
